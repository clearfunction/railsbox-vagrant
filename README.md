# OFFICIAL MO-APPROVED README
This is a vagrant box for the days when you're working in Windows but you get a Rails ticket to work on and you don't want to reboot.  It gives you ubuntu and basic rails deps.  ssh in to win!

Rails dev vagrant file - postgres, redis, ubuntu 14.04, no rvm cause you need to install that yourself as user (todo: automate that too)
